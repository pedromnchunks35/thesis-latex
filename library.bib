Blockchain technology helps organizations to solve this problem without the need for third parties. Blockchain depends on cryptography, distributed ledgers and consensus protocols to establish the trust between participating entities. Permissioned Blockchain offers features that suits the enterprise environment like accountability where all actions are traceable and privacy where the details of the actions are visible to authorized parties only. Permissioned Blockchain platforms are the toolkits that helps in building new applications that implement new business models or enhance old workflows based on Blockchain technology. By the end of this tutorial, attendees will be able to setup development environment and build quick proof of concept projects based on two open source permissioned Blockchain platforms (namely Hyperledger Fabric and Corda).},

While there are generic blockchains that can be molded for specific use cases, they often lack a lightweight and easy-to-customize implementation. In this paper, we introduce the core concepts of blockchain technology and investigate a real-world use case from the energy domain, where customers trade portions of their photovoltaic power plant via a blockchain. This does not only involve blockchain technology, but also requires user interaction. Therefore, a fully custom, private, and permissioned blockchain is implemented from scratch. We evaluate and motivate the need for blockchain technology within this use case, as well as the desired properties of the system. We then describe the implementation and the insights from our implementation in detail, serving as a guide for others and to show potential opportunities and pitfalls when implementing a blockchain from scratch.},

Based on a systematic literature review, this article analyzes different approaches to blockchain governance across disciplines and develops a comprehensive conceptual framework for the study of blockchain governance decisions in the public sector. The framework clusters nine types of governance decisions (infrastructure architecture, application architecture, interoperability, decision-making mechanism, incentive mechanism, consensus mechanism, organization of governance, accountability of governance, and control of governance) into three levels of analysis (micro, meso, and macro-levels). Drawing on public management theories and concepts, the article elucidates the implications of various governance choices in each level of governance and provides a primer for researchers and policy practitioners on the design of blockchain-based systems in the public sector.}

Developing countries have witnessed great digital transformation, and one of the key challenges during this development phase has been to create a platform that integrates the health and vitals of citizens confidentially. The healthcare insurance industry is one sector that has experienced a significant number of instances of fraudulent claims and mismanagement of patient data. These issues often arise due to inadequate technological integration and an over-reliance on manual processes and human intervention. The insurance industry relies on multiple processes between end users to initiate, maintain, and close diverse policies. The proposed model initially recommends a suitable insurance policy for newly admitted patients, but in the case of existing patients, the objectives are to speed up transaction processing and payment settlement securely using a private blockchain. Collectively, these two technologies possess the potential to revolutionize the future. This study aims to incorporate blockchain and ML techniques like Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest Regression, which can differentiate between fraudulent and legal medical records to recommend personalized policies, streamline claim processing, and ensure the security of sensitive patient information and vital insurance records. The key aim is to create a more patient-centric environment with data transparency. This integrated framework results in a secure, adaptable, and efficient ecosystem that outperforms traditional methods, paving the way for the future of healthcare and insurance services.}

	abstract = {Service meshes play a central role in the modern application ecosystem by providing an easy and flexible way to connect microservices of a distributed application. However, because of how they interpose on application traffic, they can substantially increase application latency and its resource consumption. We develop a tool called MeshInsight to help developers quantify the overhead of service meshes in deployment scenarios of interest and make informed trade-offs about their functionality vs. overhead. Using MeshInsight, we confirm that service meshes can have high overhead---up to 269\% higher latency and up to 163\% more virtual CPU cores for our benchmark applications---but the severity is intimately tied to how they are configured and the application workload. IPC (inter-process communication) and socket writes dominate when the service mesh operates as a TCP proxy, but protocol parsing dominates when it operates as an HTTP proxy. MeshInsight also enables us to study the end-to-end impact of optimizations to service meshes. We show that not all seemingly-promising optimizations lead to a notable overhead reduction in realistic settings.},
