	abstract = {Service meshes play a central role in the modern application ecosystem by providing an easy and flexible way to connect microservices of a distributed application. However, because of how they interpose on application traffic, they can substantially increase application latency and its resource consumption. We develop a tool called MeshInsight to help developers quantify the overhead of service meshes in deployment scenarios of interest and make informed trade-offs about their functionality vs. overhead. Using MeshInsight, we confirm that service meshes can have high overhead---up to 269\% higher latency and up to 163\% more virtual CPU cores for our benchmark applications---but the severity is intimately tied to how they are configured and the application workload. IPC (inter-process communication) and socket writes dominate when the service mesh operates as a TCP proxy, but protocol parsing dominates when it operates as an HTTP proxy. MeshInsight also enables us to study the end-to-end impact of optimizations to service meshes. We show that not all seemingly-promising optimizations lead to a notable overhead reduction in realistic settings.},

The information-centric service mesh offers service-centric networking, not connectivity-based networking provided by the current container orchestration, like Kubernetes (K8s). We implement the information-centric service mesh by adopting an ambassador container style and using Cefore and Cefpyco which is the CCNx software implementation developed by NICT in Japan. For the proof-of-concept test, we demonstrate the end-to-end delay of more complex service chain models (up to 17 nodes) on our K8s cluster.},

	abstract = {Load balancing is a foundational function of datacenter infrastructures and is critical to the performance of online services hosted in datacenters. As the demand for cloud services grows, expensive and hard-to-scale dedicated hardware load balancers are being replaced with software load balancers that scale using a distributed data plane that runs on commodity servers. Software load balancers offer low cost, high availability and high flexibility, but suffer high latency and low capacity per load balancer, making them less than ideal for applications that demand either high throughput, or low latency or both. In this paper, we present Duet, which offers all the benefits of software load balancer, along with low latency and high availability -- at next to no cost. We do this by exploiting a hitherto overlooked resource in the data center networks -- the switches themselves. We show how to embed the load balancing functionality into existing hardware switches, thereby achieving organic scalability at no extra cost. For flexibility and high availability, Duet seamlessly integrates the switch-based load balancer with a small deployment of software load balancer. We enumerate and solve several architectural and algorithmic challenges involved in building such a hybrid load balancer. We evaluate Duet using a prototype implementation, as well as extensive simulations driven by traces from our production data centers. Our evaluation shows that Duet provides 10x more capacity than a software load balancer, at a fraction of a cost, while reducing latency by a factor of 10 or more, and is able to quickly adapt to network dynamics including failures.},

	ABSTRACT = {The Interplanetary File System (IPFS), a new type of P2P file system, enables people to obtain data from other peer nodes in a distributed system without the need to establish a connection with a distant server. However, IPFS suffers from low resolution efficiency and duplicate data delivery, resulting in poor system availability. The new Information-Centric Networking (ICN), on the other hand, applies the features of name resolution service and caching to achieve fast location and delivery of content. Therefore, there is a potential to optimize the availability of IPFS systems from the network layer. In this paper, we propose an ICN-based IPFS high-availability architecture, called IBIHA, which introduces enhanced nodes and information tables to manage data delivery based on the original IPFS network, and uses the algorithm of selecting high-impact nodes from the entitled network (PwRank) as the basis for deploying enhanced nodes in the network, thus achieving the effect of optimizing IPFS availability. The experimental results show that this architecture outperforms the IPFS network in terms of improving node resolution efficiency, reducing network redundant packets, and improving the rational utilization of network link resources.},

	DOI={10.52436/1.jutif.2023.4.3.1030}, abstractNote={&lt;p&gt;Centralized storage is a data storage model in which data is stored and managed in a single physical location or centralized system. In this model, all data and information are stored on servers or data centers managed by one entity or organization. This model also has disadvantages such as risk of system failure against distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks, natural disasters, and hardware failures causing a single point of failure. This threat results in loss of data and a lack of user confidence in the availability of data in centralized storage. This study proposes to evaluate the availability of data in decentralized data storage using a four-node interplanetary file system (IPFS) that is interconnected with a swarm key as the authentication key. Unlike centralized storage which has only one data center, four-node IPFS allows users to upload and download data from four interconnected data centers. This can avoid dependence on the central server and reduce server load. The evaluation results show that decentralized data storage using a four-node IPFS system is three times more resilient than centralized storage against a single point of failure. This system can increase data availability so that organizations can minimize data loss from the threat of system failure.&lt;/p&#38;gt;},

	abstract = {Blockchain and Machine Learning (ML) are state-of-the-art technologies in the digital era. Developing countries have witnessed great digital transformation, and one of the key challenges during this development phase has been to create a platform that integrates the health and vitals of citizens confidentially. The healthcare insurance industry is one sector that has experienced a significant number of instances of fraudulent claims and mismanagement of patient data. These issues often arise due to inadequate technological integration and an over-reliance on manual processes and human intervention. The insurance industry relies on multiple processes between end users to initiate, maintain, and close diverse policies. The proposed model initially recommends a suitable insurance policy for newly admitted patients, but in the case of existing patients, the objectives are to speed up transaction processing and payment settlement securely using a private blockchain. Collectively, these two technologies possess the potential to revolutionize the future. This study aims to incorporate blockchain and ML techniques like Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Random Forest Regression, which can differentiate between fraudulent and legal medical records to recommend personalized policies, streamline claim processing, and ensure the security of sensitive patient information and vital insurance records. The key aim is to create a more patient-centric environment with data transparency. This integrated framework results in a secure, adaptable, and efficient ecosystem that outperforms traditional methods, paving the way for the future of healthcare and insurance services.}

Based on a systematic literature review, this article analyzes different approaches to blockchain governance across disciplines and develops a comprehensive conceptual framework for the study of blockchain governance decisions in the public sector. The framework clusters nine types of governance decisions (infrastructure architecture, application architecture, interoperability, decision-making mechanism, incentive mechanism, consensus mechanism, organization of governance, accountability of governance, and control of governance) into three levels of analysis (micro, meso, and macro-levels). Drawing on public management theories and concepts, the article elucidates the implications of various governance choices in each level of governance and provides a primer for researchers and policy practitioners on the design of blockchain-based systems in the public sector.}

	abstract = {Enterprise organizations spends a lot of time and money on establishing trust when shared date is presented to others and might rely on third parties. Blockchain technology helps organizations to solve this problem without the need for third parties. Blockchain depends on cryptography, distributed ledgers and consensus protocols to establish the trust between participating entities. Permissioned Blockchain offers features that suits the enterprise environment like accountability where all actions are traceable and privacy where the details of the actions are visible to authorized parties only. Permissioned Blockchain platforms are the toolkits that helps in building new applications that implement new business models or enhance old workflows based on Blockchain technology. By the end of this tutorial, attendees will be able to setup development environment and build quick proof of concept projects based on two open source permissioned Blockchain platforms (namely Hyperledger Fabric and Corda).},

Cryptocurrencies, which are increasing in popularity in the world and whose academic literature is rapidly developing, are considered "quasi-money" because they do not perform all the functions of money. The production and access of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) through blockchain technology represents the pinnacle of innovation in financial technology. BTC dominates the cryptocurrency market with the highest share, which does not yet have a physical form and any central authority or mediator controlling it. The key to a digital money transfer system that is independent of a central authority and trust is cryptographic mechanisms. Since BTC enables fast money transfer, it is included in wallets by the IMF, the World Bank and some central banks. The cryptocurrency system has divided the Islamic world, like the Western world, into two or even three fronts. This study aims to draw a framework for some strong (S), weak (W), opportunistic (O) and threatening (T) aspects of cryptocurrencies.}, number={13}, publisher={Salim DURUKOĞLU} }
