In this section i felt the need to provide special words of gratitude to the many persons who have 
supported me so far, during the process toward bringing this thesis to completion.

I would like to express my most sincere and great 
respect to my advisor, Tiago Guimaraes, for his inspiring guidance, 
valuable insights and endless patience. His technical contributions and encouragement 
were of extreme relevance in shaping this work, and i am deeply indebted due to his investment 
of time and effort in my growth as a researcher and student.

Also, i would like to mention Centro Algoritmi for affording 
me the means and facilities necessary for my work. I would like to thank [Funding Organization] 
for the financial support that made all of this possible.

On a personal note, I would like to thank as well my family and 
friends for their presence and encouragement throughout this 
difficult journey. To my parents, Pedro Silva and Helena Silva, which represented for me a role model for persisting
with hardwork and persistence. Also, the same applies To my close friends within the University, 
Tiago Martins and Jonas Barbosa, which made my life at the university easier, 
bringing motivation and making difficulties fade away.

I would, lastly, extend my appreciation to all those who have, 
one way or another, contributed toward the completion of this thesis. Without such 
help, it could not have been completed. I shall always be grateful for 
this fact and i hope this is another set of firm steps to what could be a successful career.
